Hello everyone! Snake Game represents my inaugural project in Python, and I trust you will derive enjoyment from playing this game on my preferred programming languageâ€”Python! 
The game was developed using VS Code on a Linux Mint system. 
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of working with the Linux environment, including installing and operating various programs. 
Additionally, I gained valuable experience in installing the necessary modules required for game development.
